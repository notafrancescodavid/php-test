This repository contains a PHP excercise test.

In order to execute the code it is necessary to run it from the command line.
In particular it is necessary to:

1) clone the repository from github 
2) "cd" in the directory where the repository has been cloned.
3) run "php index.php"

To change the input file it is necessary to change the variable $fileName in the file "index.php".
The $fileName variable can assume 4 values, based on the input files available under the "input" directory.
These values are:
